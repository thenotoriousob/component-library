# React Component Library

This is a React Component Library that has been built as part of the Scrimba Frontend Developer
Career path as the Solo Project for the Advanced React module.  It has been built to demonstrate
the different ways you can make reusable components. For example, by using
- props
- children
- context
- prop drilling
- compound components
- compound components with dot syntax

# What I have learned

The code is a bit of a mish mash of the different styles and it wouldn't be coded like this in
the real world but I wanted to use the different concepts that were taught as part of the course.

I discovered the <pre> tag when I was trying to find a solution to keep spacing for indenting
code for my useage sections.

When mapping over a fragment a key is still needed and to get arounf this you need to use
React.Fragment instead of the shorthand <>

I would definitely prefer each component having their own css file to make it cleaner and easier
to follow, but couldn't get this working in Scrimba

# Todos

Look at handling the the timeout in the Toast component and allow the user to pass in the time

Look more at what makes a good README file and the different badges you can add from https://shields.io/

# Challenges

There are so many different colours for different things so I didn't see the point in creating
css variables for every different colour there was on the page.

I really struggled with the positioning of the image on the testimonial section

I ran into problems with the content moving off the page when I made the window smaller, and
discovered it was because I made the body a flex container to center the content. Lesson learned :)

I wrote it over the space of a couple of weeks so I found it a challenge coming back and picking
up where I left off.

I had react-icons as a dependency but the scrimba platform doesn't seem to like that
